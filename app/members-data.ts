    bio: `Bio: Dr Chung Nguyen
Dr Chung Nguyen is currently a Postdoctoral Researcher in the School of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, at the University of Sydney. He received his PhD in Chemical Engineering in 2023 from RMIT University (Australia), where he conducted pioneering research on the development of atomically thin materials for optoelectronics and gas sensing. Prior to his PhD, he held a research position at Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology, Vietnam, focusing on catalysis and materials science.
Dr Nguyen is currently developing new catalytic systems for photoreactions, with a focus on harnessing light-driven processes for sustainable chemical synthesis. His broader research interests include functional materials for energy, sensing, antimicrobial, and catalysis.
Dr Nguyen actively collaborates across disciplines and institutions, and has extensive experience mentoring undergraduate and graduate students in both Australia and Vietnam.
